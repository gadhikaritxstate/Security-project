# MTH-IDS: A Multitiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for the Internet of Vehicles

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and required data files for MTH-IDS: A Multitiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System for the Internet of Vehicles.

## Installation

To run the notebooks in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gadhikaritxstate/Security-project.git
    

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    

## Steps involved to run the project

- Open the file named “features_in_CICD2017.ipynb” and run all the cells.
- Open the file named “features_in_CICD2017_with_two_labels” and run all the cells.
- The two files above generate “final_data_all_labels.csv”,  “features_with_two_labels.csv”, "features_with_all_labels.txt", "features_with_two_labels.txt". The two CSV files will be our primary CSV files, and we will be performing our analysis on these data. Similarly, the two .txt generated will contain important features from different fearture importance algorithms.   
- Open algo_implement.ipynb and run all the cells.
